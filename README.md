## Loom Demo Script

Hi Dr. Reynolds, here is the first draft of your new website. The design focuses on creating a calm, welcoming experience that reflects your therapy style.

The homepage clearly communicates who you help and what issues you specialize in, which makes it easier for potential clients to connect with you.

I included a dedicated section showing your office space to build trust and help clients feel comfortable before their first session.

The site works seamlessly on mobile devices, so clients can easily contact you from their phones.

Overall, the goal was to create a professional, warm online presence that encourages visitors to take the next step toward therapy.
